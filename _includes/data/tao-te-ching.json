{"quote":"Care at the End\n\nHe who acts, spoils;\nHe who grasps, loses.\nPeople often fail on the verge of success;\nTake care at the end as at the beginning,\nSo that you may avoid failure.\nThe sage desires no-desire,\nValues no-value,\nLearns no-learning,\nAnd returns to the places that people have forgotten;\nHe would help all people to become natural,\nBut then he would not be natural.\n", "author": "Lao Tzu, “Tao Te Ching”"},
{"quote":"Subtlety\n\nThe ancients did not seek to rule people with knowledge,\nBut to help them become natural.\nIt is difficult for knowledgeable people to become natural.\nTo use law to control a nation weakens the nation.\nBut to use nature to control a nation strengthens the nation.\nUnderstanding these two paths is understanding subtlety;\nSubtlety runs deep, ranges wide,\nResolves confusion and preserves peace.\n", "author": "Lao Tzu, “Tao Te Ching”"},
{"quote":"Lead by Following\n\nThe river carves out the valley by flowing beneath it.\nThereby the river is the master of the valley.\nIn order to master people\nOne must speak as their servant;\nIn order to lead people\nOne must follow them.\nSo when the sage rises above the people,\nThey do not feel oppressed;\nAnd when the sage stands before the people,\nThey do not feel hindered.\nSo the popularity of the sage does not fail,\nHe does not contend, and no one contends against him.\n", "author": "Lao Tzu, “Tao Te Ching”"},
{"quote":"Unimportance\n\nAll the world says,\n“I am important;\nI am separate from all the world.\nI am important because I am separate,\nWere I the same, I could never be important.”\nYet here are three treasures\nThat I cherish and commend to you:\nThe first is compassion,\nBy which one finds courage.\nThe second is restraint,\nBy which one finds strength.\nAnd the third is unimportance,\nBy which one finds influence.\nThose who are fearless, but without compassion,\nPowerful, but without restraint,\nOr influential, yet important,\nCannot endure.\n", "author": "Lao Tzu, “Tao Te Ching”"},
{"quote":"Compassion\n\nCompassion is the finest weapon and best defence.\nIf you would establish harmony,\nCompassion must surround you like a fortress.\nTherefore,\nA good soldier does not inspire fear;\nA good fighter does not display aggression;\nA good conqueror does not engage in battle;\nA good leader does not exercise authority.\nThis is the value of unimportance;\nThis is how to win the cooperation of others;\nThis to how to build the same harmony that is in nature.\n", "author": "Lao Tzu, “Tao Te Ching”"},
{"quote":"Ambush\n\nThere is a saying among soldiers:\nIt is easier to lose a yard than take an inch.\nIn this manner one may deploy troops without marshalling them,\nBring weapons to bear without exposing them,\nEngage the foe without invading them,\nAnd exhaust their strength without fighting them.\nThere is no worse disaster than misunderstanding your enemy;\nTo do so endangers all of my treasures;\nSo when two well matched forces oppose eachother,\nThe general who maintains compassion will win.\n", "author": "Lao Tzu, “Tao Te Ching”"},
{"quote":"Individuality\n\nMy words are easy to understand\nAnd my actions are easy to perform\nYet no other can understand or perform them.\nMy words have meaning; my actions have reason;\nYet these cannot be known and I cannot be known.\nWe are each unique, and therefore valuable;\nThough the sage wears coarse clothes, his heart is jade.\n", "author": "Lao Tzu, “Tao Te Ching”"},
{"quote":"Limitation\n\nWho recognizes his limitations is healthy;\nWho ignores his limitations is sick.\nThe sage recognizes this sickness as a limitation.\nAnd so becomes immune.\n", "author": "Lao Tzu, “Tao Te Ching”"},
{"quote":"Revolution\n\nWhen people have nothing more to lose,\nThen revolution will result.\nDo not take away their lands,\nAnd do not destroy their livelihoods;\nIf your burden is not heavy then they will not shirk it.\nThe sage maintains himself but exacts no tribute,\nValues himself but requires no honours;\nHe ignores abstraction and accepts substance.\n", "author": "Lao Tzu, “Tao Te Ching”"},
{"quote":"Fate\n\nWho is brave and bold will perish;\nWho is brave and subtle will benefit.\nThe subtle profit where the bold perish\nFor Fate does not honour daring.\nAnd even the sage dares not tempt fate.\nFate does not attack, yet all things are conquered by it;\nIt does not ask, yet all things answer to it;\nIt does not call, yet all things meet it;\nIt does not plan, yet all things are determined by it.\nFate's net is vast and its mesh is coarse,\nYet none escape it.\n", "author": "Lao Tzu, “Tao Te Ching”"},
{"quote":"Execution\n\nIf people were not afraid of death,\nThen what would be the use of an executioner?\nIf people were only afraid of death,\nAnd you executed everyone who did not obey,\nNo one would dare to disobey you.\nThen what would be the use of an executioner?\nPeople fear death because death is an instrument of fate.\nWhen people are killed by execution rather than by fate,\nThis is like carving wood in the place of a carpenter.\nThose who carve wood in place of a carpenter\nOften injure their hands.\n", "author": "Lao Tzu, “Tao Te Ching”"},
{"quote":"Rebellion\n\nWhen rulers take grain so that they may feast,\nTheir people become hungry;\nWhen rulers take action to serve their own interests,\nTheir people become rebellious;\nWhen rulers take lives so that their own lives are maintained,\nTheir people no longer fear death.\nWhen people act without regard for their own lives\nThey overcome those who value only their own lives.\n", "author": "Lao Tzu, “Tao Te Ching”"},
{"quote":"Flexibility\n\nA newborn is soft and tender,\nA crone, hard and stiff.\nPlants and animals, in life, are supple and succulent;\nIn death, withered and dry.\nSo softness and tenderness are attributes of life,\nAnd hardness and stiffness, attributes of death.\nJust as a sapless tree will split and decay\nSo an inflexible force will meet defeat;\nThe hard and mighty lie beneath the ground\nWhile the tender and weak dance on the breeze above.\n", "author": "Lao Tzu, “Tao Te Ching”"},
{"quote":"Need\n\nIs the action of nature not unlike drawing a bow?\nWhat is higher is pulled down, and what is lower is raised up;\nWhat is taller is shortened, and what is thinner is broadened;\nNature's motion decreases those who have more than they need\nAnd increases those who need more than they have.\nIt is not so with Man.\nMan decreases those who need more than they have\nAnd increases those who have more than they need.\nTo give away what you do not need is to follow the Way.\nSo the sage gives without expectation,\nAccomplishes without claiming credit,\nAnd has no desire for ostentation.\n", "author": "Lao Tzu, “Tao Te Ching”"},
{"quote":"Yielding\n\nNothing in the world is as soft and yielding as water,\nYet nothing can better overcome the hard and strong,\nFor they can neither control nor do away with it.\nThe soft overcomes the hard,\nThe yielding overcomes the strong;\nEvery person knows this,\nBut no one can practice it.\nWho attends to the people would control the land and grain;\nWho attends to the state would control the whole world;\nTruth is easily hidden by rhetoric.\n", "author": "Lao Tzu, “Tao Te Ching”"},
{"quote":"Reconciliation\n\nWhen conflict is reconciled, some hard feelings remain;\nThis is dangerous.\nThe sage accepts less than is due\nAnd does not blame or punish;\nFor harmony seeks agreement\nWhere justice seeks payment.\nThe ancients said: “nature is impartial;\nTherefore it serves those who serve all.”\n", "author": "Lao Tzu, “Tao Te Ching”"},
{"quote":"Utopia\n\nLet your community be small, with only a few people;\nKeep tools in abundance, but do not depend upon them;\nAppreciate your life and be content with your home;\nSail boats and ride horses, but don't go too far;\nKeep weapons and armour, but do not employ them;\nLet everyone read and write,\nEat well and make beautiful things.\nLive peacefully and delight in your own society;\nDwell within cock-crow of your neighbours,\nBut maintain your independence from them.\n", "author": "Lao Tzu, “Tao Te Ching”"},
{"quote":"The Sage\n\nHonest people use no rhetoric;\nRhetoric is not honesty.\nEnlightened people are not cultured;\nCulture is not enlightenment.\nContent people are not wealthy;\nWealth is not contentment.\nSo the sage does not serve himself;\nThe more he does for others, the more he is satisfied;\nThe more he gives, the more he receives.\nNature flourishes at the expense of no one;\nSo the sage benefits all men and contends with none.\n", "author": "Lao Tzu, “Tao Te Ching”"}
