A collection always contain two files: "foo" and "foo.dat".  "foo" is
a collection of fortune cookies, each separated from the next by a
percent character on a line by itself. "foo.dat" is an index into the
file "foo" created by the strfile(8) program.

For details on the installation of the fortune files, see the manual
pages on your system.  On my system, I copy "foo" and "foo.dat" into
/usr/local/share/fortune/.  This may vary, of course.  Then, I start
fortune from my .profile file using all the fortune files in the
directories specified:

    fortune -a /usr/share/fortune /usr/local/share/fortune

In order to get a fortune cookie from collection "foo" only:

    fortune /usr/local/share/fortune/foo
